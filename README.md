🎓 With the aim of creating a high-quality learning environment alongside the development of information technology, a software system has been designed to serve as a comprehensive academic management platform.

With separate login functions for lecturers and students, the system ensures data security and easy access to necessary information. Additionally, the software offers a user-friendly interface that is easy for everyone to use.

🎓 In the lecturer login sessions, users have the right to access and manage student information. Lecturers can also manage their personal information, degrees, and expertise. The software provides lecturers with the ability to update course content and support student competency assessment through quizzes.

🎓 With the student login function, users can manage their personal information. Furthermore, they have access to their academic progress and grades.
